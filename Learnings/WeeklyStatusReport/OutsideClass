THINGS LEARNED/SKILLS ACCQUIRED OUTSIDE THE CLASS.

WEEK 1 : 3/1/17 - 8/1/17

1] Read the paper "The Humble Programmer" By Edsgar W. Dijkstra and learned about the challenges faced by the
   Computer Science community during that period,and How Dijkstra envisioned the development of programming (Which was
   a new profession at that time) and Computer Science as a whole.
   
   SPECIFICS :
               1] People believed that once powerful machines were available, programming would cease to be a problem.
                  On the contrary though,the advancements in technology expanded the society's ambitions to apply these
                  machines to solve problems.However,programming had not been able to keep up with these changes.  
                  
               2] Program correctness :
                  Instead of spending time debugging,the focus should be to not leave any room for errors to begin with.
                  HOW?
                  -Read about pre condition,post condition and termination(well ordered principle).
                  -Read about proving correctness of iterative programs(Loop invariants).
                  -Read about proving correctness of recursive programs.
                  
                3]-Read about Fortran,ALGOL 60 and Lisp(History).
                
2] Read Leslie Lamport's contributions to Computer science.

   SPECIFICS :
              1] The Bakery Algorithm / Mutual exclusion and its application to Concurrent Programming.
              
              2] Foundations of distributed systems.
               
              3] Fault tolerance and state machine replication (Did not understand much).
              
              4] LaTeX.
              
3] Initially, the idea for the project was to create a Chat bot for Facebook Messenger using Facebook's Graph API.
   (Which was later scrapped.)
   
  1] Learnt PHP .
  
  2] Learnt basics of Json.
