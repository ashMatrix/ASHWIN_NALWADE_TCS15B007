THINGS LEARNED INSIDE THE CLASS.

WEEK 1 : 3/1/17 - 8/1/17.

1] Learned about various types/nature of programming languages (Imperative,Functional,Logical,Object Oriented).

2] Learned about the various avenues of research present in Computer Science at this moment (Human Computer Interaction,
   Artificial Intelligence,Machine Learning and so on).
   
3] Learnt how to read/summarize a scientific research paper and how to write one yourself.

4] LAB : Learned basics of HASKELL (not much).

5] Learned about the Turing award winners and read some of the Turing award Lecture.

WEEK 2 : 9/1/17 - 15/1/17.

 1] Learned about alloy,a language for describing structures and a tool for exploring them.
 
 2] Learned about static and dynamic typing.
 
 3] Learned about the compilation and interpretation process.
 
 4] Understood the difference between syntax and semantics.
 
 5] Read about recognizers and generators.
 
 6] Read about the Backus Naur form and parse trees.Was able to correlate this with what was taught in 
    Language,Machines and Computations class.
    
WEEK 3 : 16/1/17 - 22/1/17

 1] Learned about the specifics of Python and Haskell.
 
 2] Haskell:
    -It is a lazy language.
    -It is statically typed.
    -Learned about ghci(glasgow haskell interpreter compiler).
    -enumerations in c v/s enumerations in haskell.
    
 3] Python : Already know python.
 
WEEK 4 : 23/1/17 - 29/1/17
  1]Revised Syntax and Semantics.
    -tokens
    -lexemes
    -parsers
    -lexers
    -Backus Naur Form
 
WEEK 5 : 30/1/17 - 5/2/17
  1] Nil (Made Presentation for Groovy)

WEEK 6 : 6/2/17 - 12/2/17
  1] Learnt about how we can use any paradigm in any language (objective C).
  2] Came to know about different styles of programming:
     -Programming with linited memory (memory reuse and release)
     -Cookbook
     -Code golf
     -Pipeline
     -Infinite Mirror
     -Kick it forward
     
   3] Realized that it is better to rely on abstractions,rather than concrete structures.
   4] Analysis of recursion in imperative language v/s recursion in functional language.
   5] Came to know about noSql and pipelining in linux environment.

WEEK 7 : 13/2/17 - 20/2/17
  1] Came to know about Virtual Reality and Unity.
  2] Recognized the similiarities between programming and film making.

WEEK 8 : 21/2/17 - 28/2/17
  1] Got a clearer view of the process of building an interpreter (namely Abstract syntax trees and parser).
  2] Realized what revisions could be done to the current version of the interpreter.
